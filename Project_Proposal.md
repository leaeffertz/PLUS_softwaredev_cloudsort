# Project Proposal

## Group
 - Yana Nikolova
 - Miracle Chinwe Owhorji
 - Damilola Oluwaseun Alfred
 - Lea Effertz

## Project description
We want to do a custom sort in Google Earth Engine (Python API) for a custom Area chosen by the user, so you do not have to work with the entire dataset,
as that is very ressource intensive.
Conventionally, filtering cloud free images in Google Earth Engine is done with the `.sort`- Algorithm, using the property `'CLOUD_COVER'`. 
This property is for the whole image scene and not for a single area of interest. We want to create a custom script that calculates the cloud coverage only for the area of interest and sorts the images by the resulting percentage of cloud coverage.

## Goals

### Yana Nikolova
Learn about the Python API, because you mostly worked with Java Script before.

### Miracle Chinwe Owhorji
Learn more about Cloud coverage and image pre-processing.

### Damilola Oluwaseun Alfred
Learn more about Python packages and functions and practically applying them.

### Lea Effertz
Learn more about the GEE-Python API and working with image sorting.

## Responsibilities  

### Issues:
1. Access to Python API - Miracle & Dammy

2. Basic Code - Miracle & Dammy

3. Determine Cloud Cover - Yana & Lea

4. Sort by Cloud Cover & Quality Check - Yana & Lea

5. Finalise Jupyter Notebook - everyone

6. User Guide/Documention - everyone documents their own part

(7. Research how to create Python Package - everyone/anyone who has time)
