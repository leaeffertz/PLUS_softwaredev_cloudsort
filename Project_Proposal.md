# Project Proposal

## Group
 - Yana Nikolova
 - Miracle Chinwe Owhorji
 - Damilola Oluwaseun Alfred
 - Lea Effertz

## Project description
We want to do a custom sort in Google Earth Engine (Python API) for a custom Area chosen by the user, so you do not have to work with the entire dataset,
as that is very ressource intensive.
Conventionally, filtering cloud free images in Google Earth Engine is done with the `.sort`- Algorithm, using the property `'CLOUD_COVER'`. 
This property is for the whole imnage scene and not for a single area of interest. We want to create a custom package that solves that issue.

## Goals
    your goals of what each of you wants to learn more about (e.g. a specific python package, writing and using functions, building a python package, writing documentation, ...)
