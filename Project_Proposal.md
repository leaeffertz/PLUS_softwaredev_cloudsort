# Project Proposal

## Group
 - Yana Nikolova
 - Miracle Chinwe Owhorji
 - Damilola Oluwaseun Alfred
 - Lea Effertz

## Project description
We want to do a custom sort in Google Earth Engine (Python API) for a custom Area chosen by the user, so you do not have to work with the entire dataset,
as that is very ressource intensive.
Conventionally, filtering cloud free images in Google Earth Engine is done with the `.sort`- Algorithm, using the property `'CLOUD_COVER'`. 
This property is for the whole imnage scene and not for a single area of interest. We want to create a custom package that solves that issue.

- image masked in two categories
   - creating new nr for the area of interest
   - create function that creates new cloud coverage
   - sort by new nrs

## Goals
    _your goals of what each of you wants to learn more about (e.g. a specific python package, writing and using functions, building a python package, writing documentation, ...)_
### Yana Nikolova
Learn about the Python API, because you mostly worked with Java Script before.

### Miracle Chinwe Owhorji
Learn more about Cloud coverage and image pre-processing.

### Damilola Oluwaseun Alfred
Learn more about Python packages and functions and practically applying them.

### Lea Effertz
Learn more about the GEE-Python API and working with image sorting.

## Responsibilities  
Include who is responsible for what (this can change any time, but you will have to explain why later)
