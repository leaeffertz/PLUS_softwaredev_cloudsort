# Sorting of Cloud Cover in Sentinel Imagery using (Python and GEE) #

This python group project aims to sort, classify and remove cloud-contaminated pixels from satellite imagery (sentinel imagery) within a defined Area of Interest (AOI), using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and python (geemap). Cloud masking on GEE involves the identification and removal of cloud-contaminated pixels from satellite imagery. Sentinel-2, equipped with the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), captures high-resolution multispectral data. However, cloud cover can hinder the interpretation of Earthâ€™s surface features. Removing cloud contaminated pixels using python technique (GEE) enhances the usability of Sentinel-2 imagery for various applications, including land cover classification, vegetation and environmental monitoring, and change detection.

# 1. Existing Classifications for Cloud Coverage
It's critical to comprehend the current cloud cover categories used in remote sensing before creating our own approach. Numerous satellite data sources currently use automated methods to classify cloud coverage, including Sentinel-2 and Landsat.

Sentinel-2 detects and categorizes clouds using the Sen2Cor algorithm. Clouds are hidden by Landsat using the Fmask algorithm.

These algorithms determine the percentage of cloud cover at the pixel level and label image accordingly. By including user-defined thresholds and pixel-level cloud masking inside a custom AOI, this project expands on previous techniques.

2. How Current Algorithms Operate
Current cloud detection algorithms examine spectral bands that record specific light wavelengths, aiding in the differentiation of clouds from other elements such as land, water, and vegetation.

3. Project Setup
Gaining Access to GEE Make sure you have access to the Google Earth Engine (GEE) Python API before beginning to use the project. For further information on how to install the required tools (geemap) and obtain access to the API, you can refer to Open Geospatial Solutions' tutorial. Output: All project group member should be able to access and utilize GEE in Python by the time this phase is finished.
python code
import ee import geemap

Collection of Filtered Images To begin, define an area of interest (AOI) by creating a bounding box on a map or by using a shapefile.
python code
aoi = ee.Geometry.Rectangle([min_lon, min_lat, max_lon, max_lat])

Filter by Date The next action is to apply a date range filter on satellite images. For instance, we decide to use pictures taken between 2020 and 2021.
python code
sentinel2 = ee.ImageCollection('COPERNICUS/S2_SR_HARMONIZED')
.filterBounds(aoi)
.filterDate('2020-01-01', '2021-01-01')
.filterMetadata('CLOUDY_PIXEL_PERCENTAGE', 'less_than', 50)

Select the Image Source We will extract the image collection from GEE using an exemplary imaging source, like Sentinel-2 or Landsat 8.
5. Sorting Cloud Coverage
We will filter the image collection to only include images with cloud cover below 50-60% in the AOI.

6. Cloud Masking at the pixel level
To further refine our data, we will apply a pixel-level cloud mask using GEE's built-in tools. This ensures that the images selected for analysis have minimal cloud interference over our AOI.

Python code Create a cloud mask for Sentinel-2 images def cloud_mask(image): cloud_prob = image.select('MSK_CLDPRB') cloud_mask = cloud_prob.lt(20) return image.updateMask(cloud_mask)

7. Sorting by Cloud Coverage
After applying the cloud mask, we will sort the resulting images by their cloud coverage percentage to ensure we are working with the clearest images possible.

python code

Sort images by cloud coverage in the AOI
sorted_images = sentinel2.sort('CLOUDY_PIXEL_PERCENTAGE')

8. Jupyter Notebook
We provide a Jupyter Notebook that combines the code used in this project. The notebook is well-documented, and the code is structured for ease of understanding.

Important Sections:

Accessing and filtering GEE data. Implementing cloud masking. Sorting and displaying results.

9. Educational Materials
For additional learning, see the resources in the learning_resources.md file, which include links to pertinent guides, instructions, and videos for the GEE, geemap, and cloud cover classification techniques. The goals of the project, the workflow, and the ways in which users can engage with the tool are all explained in detail by this framework. Depending on the requirements of your project, you can change certain elements or add more specifics.
