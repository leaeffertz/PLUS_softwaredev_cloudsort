    "# Sorting an image collection by Cloud Coverage for a small area of interest\n",
    "\n",
    "We created this tool to help with finding cloud-free Sentinel-2 (S2) images for an area of interest (AOI). Google Earth Engine allows you to sort S2 images by an image  property called \"CLOUDY_PIXEL_PERCENTAGE\" which represents the percentage of clouds calculated for the entire S2 image. WHen working with small AOIs, however, this approach might filter out cloudy images which are in fact cloud-free for the specific AOI. To remedy this, we decided to create a Jupyter-Notebook, where Sentinel-2 image collection can be sorted based on the cloudiness of a specific AOI, rather than on the one of the overall image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to utilize this notebook, you just have to install geopandas and geemap, as well as create a google-earth-engine project, that you want to use and fill in your paramters when needed.\n",
    "You will need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a Shapefile specifying you aoi (make sure that the shapefile is in a location that can be read from by jupyter)\n",
    "\n",
    "- the date-range you are interested in\n",
    "\n",
    "- optionally: the tile you want to use\n",
    "  and if you want to utilize an s2cloudless dataset to calculate the cloudiness of you pictures, you can later select additional paramters for that if you want to or just stick with the default parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run the Notebook multiple times and all the layers are all already added to the map, it may be that there is an error that states that there is too much data to display, if this is the case, please just execute the cell you are interested in again, then it should display and render the map without problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model was tested on a AOI of 18 square kilometers in a riparian forest of the Natura 2000 zone Salzachauen, Austria. The results were compared with reference data of cloud-free images obained through visual evaluation. The visual interpratation showed 12 cloud-free images for the year 2020. Dates of the images can be found in Validation_cloudfree_dates.txt file. Since our model sorts images depending on their cloud  cover we filtered and desplayed only the first 12 images of the sorted collection. 9 of those images correpond to the ones identified in the refference data. In the 3 images left, 2 had presence of clouds.\n"
